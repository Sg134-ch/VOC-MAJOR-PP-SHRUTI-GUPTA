Personal To-Do List Application
This is a simple command-line based To-Do List Application built using Python. It allows users to manage tasks, categorize them, and persist data between sessions by storing tasks in a JSON file.

Features
Add Task: Users can add a new task with a title, description, and category (e.g., Work, Personal, Urgent).
View Tasks: Lists all tasks along with their status (Pending or Completed).
Mark Task as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed.
Delete Task: Users can delete tasks they no longer need.
Task Persistence: Tasks are saved in a tasks.json file, so they persist between program runs.
